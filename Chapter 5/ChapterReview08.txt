Is the following statement valid? If not, why not? If so, what does it do?
int x = (1,024);

Yes, it's valid and the value is 024 since the comma operators value returns the second expression
024 is an octal literal for 20, so x = 20

What about the following?
int y;
y = 1,024;

Yes, but due to the comma operator having the lowest priority, y = 1.
024, or 20, isn't used at all
