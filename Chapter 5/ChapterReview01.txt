What's the difference between an entry-condition loop and an exit-condition loop?
	An entry-condition loop's condition is evalutated prior to executing the body.
	An exit-condition executed the body and then evalutas the condition

Which kind is each of the C++ loops?
	Entry-condition: while, for, range-based for
	Exit-condition: do-while
