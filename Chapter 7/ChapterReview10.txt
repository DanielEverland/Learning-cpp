C++ enables you to pass a structure by value, and it lets you pass the address of a
structure. If glitz is a structure variable, how would you pass it by value? How
would you pass its address? What are the trade-offs of the two approaches?

Structures are passed by value by default: func(structName);
To pass the address you do the following: func(&structName);

The tradeoff is that the first approach creates a copy of the entire struct, and also
doesn't allow the function to modify the original struct in any way.
