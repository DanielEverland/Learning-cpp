Consider the following two code fragments for counting spaces and newlines:

Version 1
while (cin.get(ch))		// quit on EOF
{
	if(ch == ' ')
		spaces++;
	if(ch == '\n')
		newlines++;
}

Version 2
while(cin.get(ch))
{
	if(ch == ' ')
		spaces++;
	else if(ch == '\n')
		newlines++;
}

What advantages, if any, does the second form have over the first?

A character cannot be both a space and a newline, so the second form is more correct on a technical level, more performant, and also communicates intent best.
