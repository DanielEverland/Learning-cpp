Construct logical expressions to represent the following conditions:
a. weight is greater than or equal to 115 but less than 125.
	weight >= 115 && weight < 125

b. ch is q or Q.
	ch == 'q' || ch == 'Q'

c. x is even but is not 26.
	(x % 2 == 0) && x != 26

d. x is even but is not a multiple of 26.
	(x % 2 == 0) && (x % 26 != 0)

e. donation is in the range 1,000-2,000 or guest is 1
	(donation >= 1,000 && donation <= 2,000) || guest == 1

f. ch is lowercase letter or an uppercase letter.
(Assume, as is true for ASCII, that lowercase letters are coded sequentially and uppercase letters are coded sequentially
	but that there is a gap in the code between uppercase and lowercase)

	(ch >= int('a') && ch <= int('z')) || (ch >= int('A') && ch <= int('Z'))
