a.
double & rx					w is an lvalue, therefore it's assignable and not const
const double & rx			w + 1 is an rvalue, therefore const
const double & rx			up(w) is an rvalue, therefore const

b.
double & rx					w is an lvalue
double && rx				w + 1 is an rvalue
double && rx				up(w) is an rvalue

c.
const double & rx			w is an lvalue
double && rx				w + 1 is an rvalue
double && rx				up(w) is an rvalue
