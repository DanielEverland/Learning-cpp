a. both.
mass(double density, double volume)
mass(double density, volume = 1)
mass(double density)

b. only overloading, since defaults are right-to-left
double repeat(int times, char* str);
double repeat(char* str);

c. only overloading
int average(int, int)
double average(double, double)

d. neither, prototyping doesn't descriminate pointer vs. non-pointer
