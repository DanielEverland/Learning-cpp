1. What are the modules of a C++ program called?
	Functions

2. What does the following preprocessor directive do?
		#include <iostream>
	It tells the compiler to include the library "iostream" in my program

3. What does the following statement do?
		using namespace std;
	It allows my program to use the functions in the std library, either to the entire program or just the function it's declared in, depending on where it's declared

4. What statement would you use to print the phrase "Hello, world" and then start a new line?
	cout << "Hello, world" << endl;

5. What statement would you use to create an integer variable with the name cheeses?
	int cheeses;

6. What statement would you use to assign the value 32 to the variable cheeses?
	cheeses = 32;

7. What statement would you use to read a value from keyboard input into the variable cheeses?
	cin >> cheeses;

8. What statement would you use to print "We have X varieties of cheese", where the current value of cheese variable replaces x?
	cout << "We have " << cheeses << " varieties of cheese";

9. What do the following function prototypes tell you about the functions?
		int froop(double t);
		void rattle(int n);
		int prune(void);

	Froop has a single parameter of type double called t, and returns a value of type int
	rattle has a single parameter of type int, and does not return any value
	prune has no parameters, and returns a value of type int

10. When do you not have the use the keyword return when you define a function?
	If the return value of the function is void

11. Suppose your main() function has the following line
		cout << "Please enter your PIN: ";
	
		And suppose the compiler complains that cout is an unknown identifier. What is likely the cause of this complaint, and what are the three ways to fix the problem?

		The cause is that the std namespace isn't used anywhere.
		1. using namespace std; in program
		2. using namespace std; in function
		3. Explicitly defining the use of std in the function call std:cout << (...)
